# My Open Source Contributions

Here are some of the open source projects I have contributed to:

- [Stdlib-js](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib): I contributed to the stdlib-js/stdlib repository by adding accessor arrays support to seven packages: nanmeanors, nanmskrange, nanstdevyc, nanvariancech, nanvariancepn, nanmskmax, and nanvarianceyc. These pull requests implemented the accessor protocol to enable efficient computation of statistical measures (mean, range, standard deviation, variance, and maximum) on array-like objects, ignoring NaN values, with updates to core logic, tests, and documentation.

- [Neutralino.js](https://github.com/neutralinojs): I have actively contributed to the Neutralino.js ecosystem by implementing key features and fixes. Notably, I renamed the macOS output folder to .app in neu build and added support for copying extra files to the dist folder, both of which were merged into the main codebase. Additionally, I improved argument handling with spaces in neu run, and created the neu template plugin for the neu CLI, allowing developers to save local projects as reusable templates for more efficient future development.
